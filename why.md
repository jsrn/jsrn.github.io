title: Why do I maintain this website?
---

I maintain this site because [self-publishing](/make-your-own-website) on the web is the best way to maintain control of your own stuff in the long term. I'm not that old, but I've seen plenty of platforms come, go, or worse [stay](https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys), and the common element of every situation is that your data, having never really been yours to begin with, is either locked away or is a pain in the butt to move elsewhere.

I like personal websites, blogs, and [digital gardens](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) and I think that the care put into creating and maintaining these spaces online can lead to more lasting [connections](/links) with both ideas and people.

This website is statically generated using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) because when the output is a folder of HTML files, I can take it pretty much anywhere.

I do my best to avoid unecessary JavaScript, and there are no analytics on this site. Consequently, if you want to give me a little buzz of endorphins about anything on this site, reach out by <a href="mailto:james@jsrn.net?subject=Let's be friends">email</a>.
