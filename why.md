# Why do I maintain this website?

I maintain this site because I believe self-publishing on the web is the only viable long term way to maintain control of your own stuff.

I'm interested in the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) movement and the concept of [digital gardens](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) and I hope that the care put into creating and maintaining these spaces online leads to more meaningful connections with both ideas and people. I've previously stated that [it's time for link pages](/miscellaneous/2019/02/27/its-time-for-link-pages.html) to make a comeback and I stand by that.

This website is statically generated using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) because when the output is a folder of HTML files, I can take it pretty much anywhere.

I do my best to avoid unecessary JavaScript, and there are no analytics on this site. Consequently, if you want to give me a little buzz of endorphins about anything on this site, reach out by <a href="mailto:jsrn@hey.com?subject=Let's be friends">email</a>.
