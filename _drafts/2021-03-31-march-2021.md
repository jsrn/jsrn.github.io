# Things I Read

* [The Hidden Gems of Ruby's irb](https://technology.doximity.com/articles/the-hidden-gems-of-ruby-s-irb)

This was really cool, and prompted me to finally set up my own `.irbrc` to bring a little extra flair to my environment.

* [Digital Minimalism](https://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/) by Cal Newport

A great book that's helping me re-evaluate my relationship with technology.

* [The 5 stages of CTO & the CTO Career Chasm](https://calbucci.com/the-5-stages-of-cto-career-chasm-9d7c04e2ae66)

I recently finished reading [The Hard Thing About Hard Things](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18176747-the-hard-thing-about-hard-things), which spends some time making the point that companies in different stages of development require different types of CEO. This article makes a similar point about C**T**Os, describing the different desirable traits of a CTO in companies with a handful, a few dozen, a few hundred employees, and so on.

* [You're On Mute: The Art of Presenting in a Zoom Era](https://blog.prototypr.io/youre-on-mute-the-art-of-presenting-in-a-zoom-era-5e1f27b89f23)

Relevant to me, since I'm giving a presentation at the Ruby User Group in a couple weeks.

* [Leading your engineering team with ‘experiments’ not ‘processes’](https://leaddev.com/agile-other-ways-working/leading-your-engineering-team-experiments-not-processes?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_content=cate-huston)
