- At some point I realised that approximately half of my RSS feed was announcements about new type faces. I have no need of this, but this is fine.
- I'm trying to resist screwing around with my website's design again. I'm always torn between designs like my current, which is cute but unrefined, and the clear, uncluttered designs.
