# Rake Is Awesome

I sat down to start compiling these notes, and of course got sidetracked putting together the [Rakefile](https://github.com/ruby/rake) which can be found in the root of [this repo](https://github.com/jsrn/jsrn.github.io).

# Hacktoberfest

I was all gung-ho about getting started with Hacktoberfest this year, but I'm not sure I can muster the energy. I absolutely do not need any more t-shirts, and the negative energy around the event's growing spam problem just turns me off participating entirely.

Regardless, I'm enjoying stewarding [How Old Is It?](https://jsrn.net/howoldisit/) the only project I've had that's gotten more than 10 stars on GitHub. I hope I can at least help some other non-spammy participants get their t-shirts.

# Things I Read

* [The Self Retrospective](https://undevelopedbruce.com/2020/09/30/the-self-retrospective/)

I enjoyed this, or at least I'm in the right place to read it. The orderliness of my attempts to improve at my job and as a person waxes and wanes, and at the moment it's waning pretty hard.

* [How to remove condescending language from documentation](https://dev.to/meeshkan/how-to-remove-condescending-language-from-documentation-4a5p)

At work, there are two words that we try not to say: "just" and "should."

* [test && commit || revert](https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/test-commit-revert-870bbd756864)

A programming workflow where the tests must pass every time the code is committed. If they fail, the code is immediately reverted to the last point at which the tests passed.

* [“Fake COTS” and the one-day rule](https://sboots.ca/2020/09/16/fake-cots-and-the-one-day-rule/)

When is "off the shelf" software not really off the shelf?
