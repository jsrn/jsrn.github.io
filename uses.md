title: The things I use

## Hardware

- 15" [MacBook Pro](https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro) (2019) that my company provided.
- Apple [Magic Keyboard](https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MLA22B/A/magic-keyboard-british-english), also provided by my company. I used to use a mechanical keyboard, but now it feels intolerably thick. Maybe I'll buy one of those fancy wrist pads and try again some day.
- I used my beloved [Anker Gaming Mouse](https://www.anker.com/es/products/variant/8200-dpi-highprecision-laser-gaming-mouse/98ANDS2368-BA) until it broke and I discovered they'd discontinued that model. I splashed out for a [Logitech G502 Hero](https://www.logitechg.com/en-gb/products/gaming-mice/g502-hero-gaming-mouse.910-005471.html). I'm sure it's a great mouse, but honestly I'm not good enough at videogames for my mouse to have ever been the bottleneck.
- An MSI gaming laptop at home. Not the cheapest way to get a decent gaming rig, but boy is it pretty.
- A notebook with squared or dotted paper. Those diddly little ones are too small and A4 is too big. Roughly A5 size is perfect. Ideally nothing _so_ nice that I'll feel bad eventually recycling it. The problem with beautiful notebooks is that you want your scribblings to be deserving. That can be stifling.
- A black fineliner or gel ink pen. I'm not picky about the brand, so long as it doesn't scratch on the paper too much. I always wanted to be the kind of person who has a favourite pen and just stockpiles them, but I'm not there yet.

## Software

- [RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/) for serious Ruby work. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for all other text and code editing.
- The majority of my note-taking and journaling is done in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). For all its wonderful features, it's essentially a layer on top of a soup of version controlled markdown files. As with this website, it's important to me that so much of my important data isn't locked in to a particular vendor or platform.
- [Todoist](https://todoist.com) for holding chaos at bay.
- [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/) for subscribing to RSS feeds. It's pretty much entirely replaced my habit of scrolling through Twitter and I'm happier for it.
- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) with [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/). I wrote a little more about this in a [blog post about how I use iTerm2](/programming/2021/11/04/how-i-use-iterm2.html).
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for design work. I'm not a designer, and Figma makes it super easy to put together at least basic wireframes and prototypes without really needing to know what you're doing.
- While a lot of people dig Postman, I use [RapidAPI](https://paw.cloud/) to interact with and test APIs. It's feature-rich and works almost exactly the way I want it to.
- [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/faq) whenever I've doing web development on a Windows machine. I spent a long time rotating through various Linux distributions, but these days I don't have the patience or skill to babysit them. And I like video games too much.
- [TechSmith's SnagIt](https://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.html) is brilliant for capturing screen recordings and annotating screenshots. It's not cheap, but it is good.
- I have a [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/jsrn/dotfiles) to make my configuration as consistent as possible between systems.
- [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) for arranging my windows on MacOS.
