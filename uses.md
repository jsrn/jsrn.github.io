## Hardware

* 15" [MacBook Pro](https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro) (2019) that my company provided.
* Apple [Magic Keyboard](https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MLA22B/A/magic-keyboard-british-english), also provided by my company. I used to use a mechanical keyboard, but now it feels intolerably thick. Maybe I'll buy one of those fancy wrist pads and try again some day.
* [Anker Gaming Mouse](https://www.anker.com/es/products/variant/8200-dpi-highprecision-laser-gaming-mouse/98ANDS2368-BA).
* An MSI gaming laptop at home. It's some years old now, but still a thing of beauty.
* Squared or dotted paper and a black gel ink ballpoint or fineliner. I'm not picky about the brand, so long as it doesn't scratch on the paper too much. I always wanted to be the kind of person who has a favourite pen and just stockpiles them, but I'm not there yet.

## Software

* [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for design work. I'm not a designer, and Figma makes it super easy to put together at least basic wireframes and prototypes without really needing to know what you're doing.
* [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) with [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/).
* While a lot of people dig Postman, I use [Paw](https://paw.cloud/) to interact with and test APIs. It's feature-rich and works almost exactly the way I want it to.
* [RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/) for serious Ruby work.
* [Todoist](https://todoist.com) for holding chaos at bay.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for editing code and other text files.
* [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/faq) whenever I've doing web development on a Windows machine. I spent a long time rotating through various Linux distributions, but these days I don't have the patience or skill to babysit them. And I like video games too much.
* [TechSmith's SnagIt](https://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.html) is brilliant for capturing screen recordings and annotating screenshots. It's not cheap, but it is good.
