## Hardware

* 13" MacBook Pro (2018) that my company got for me to work with. It's the first time I've used an Apple laptop for more than 10 minutes at a time, so there's been a learning curve. The keyboard still works.
* For a second screen, I will use whatever I can scrounge from the office.
* Squared or dotted paper and a black gel ink ballpoint or fineliner. I'm not picky about the brand, so long as it doesn't scratch on the paper too much.

## Software

* [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/faq) whenever I've doing web development on a Windows machine.
* [JetBrains RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/) for Ruby development.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for everything else.
* [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for design work.
* Alternating between [Notion](https://notion.so) and [Bear](https://bear.app/) for taking notes while I figure out which I like more. Notion is very visually appealing, but I love how fast Bear is.
* [Todoist](https://todoist.com) for holding chaos at bay.
