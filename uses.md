## Hardware

* 13" MacBook Pro (2018) that my company got for me to work with. It's the first time I've used an Apple laptop for more than 10 minutes at a time, so there's been a learning curve. The keyboard still works.
* An MSI gaming laptop at home. It's some years old now, but still a thing of beauty.
* For a second screen, I will use whatever I can scrounge from the office.
* Squared or dotted paper and a black gel ink ballpoint or fineliner. I'm not picky about the brand, so long as it doesn't scratch on the paper too much.

## Software

* [Todoist](https://todoist.com) for holding chaos at bay.
* [Notion](https://notion.so) for taking notes.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editing code and other text files.
* [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/faq) whenever I've doing web development on a Windows machine. I spent a long time rotating through various Linux distributions, but these days I don't have the patience (fine, skill) to babysit them. And I like video games too much.
* [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for design work.
