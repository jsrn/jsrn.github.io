title: The things I use

## Hardware

- 16" [MacBook Pro](https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro). It has an M2 chip. I like it a lot, but it's a company machine, not mine.
- A 104 key [WASD V2](https://www.wasdkeyboards.com/products/mechanical-keyboards.html) with MX Blues. It's big and clacky and I love it. It's a pretty thick keyboard, so I asked someone selling chopping boards at a local market to make me a wrist rest out of black walnut, [the best wood](/best). In the almost ten years I've had this keyboard I've used the numpad maybe half a dozen times, so my next keyboard (if this trooper ever gives up) is going to be a slightly more compact model.
- A [Logitech G502 Hero](https://www.logitechg.com/en-gb/products/gaming-mice/g502-hero-gaming-mouse.910-005471.html) mouse. It's a great mouse, but I'm not good enough at videogames for my mouse to have ever been the bottleneck. I do love the unlockable scroll wheel for whizzing through long web pages.
- An [MSI Raider GE68](https://www.msi.com/Laptop/Raider-GE68-HX-13VX) gaming laptop at home. Not the cheapest way to get a decent gaming rig, but boy is it pretty. It has a lot of oomph, but it runs pretty hot.
- [Jabra Elite 85h (discontinued)](https://www.jabra.com/supportpages/jabra-elite-85h) cans / [Anker Liberty 4 NC](https://us.soundcore.com/products/liberty-4-nc-a3947z61) ear-buds, depending on whether I'm at home or on the go. The sound quality and noise-cancelling on both are more than good enough for me, and the batteries last for ages on one charge.
- A5 dotted notebook. Zippered [Galen Leather cover](https://www.galenleather.com/collections/zippered-leather-portfolio), which keeps the outside beautiful and the while the inside nice and disposable. This is mostly for work stuff.
- 3.5" by 5.5" notebooks in another Galen wrap. This is for general purpose notes and journaling. Journals get kept, notes get recycled.
- Pens, in descending order of preference:
  - LAMY Safari, currently with a teal Diamine ink.
  - Kaweco Sport Brass.
  - A black fineliner or gel ink pen. I'm not picky about the brand, so long as it doesn't scratch too much.
  - One of the approximately ten billion random ballpoints I've accumulated over the years.

## Software

- [RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/) for serious Ruby work. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for all other text and code editing. I try to get into neovim once a year or so. It sticks a little more each time.
- The majority of my note-taking and journaling is done in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). For all its wonderful features, it's essentially a layer on top of a soup of version controlled markdown files. As with this website, it's important to me that so much of my important data isn't locked in to a particular vendor or platform.
- [Todoist](https://todoist.com) for holding chaos at bay.
- [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/) for subscribing to RSS feeds. It's pretty much entirely replaced my habit of scrolling through Twitter and I'm happier for it.
- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) with [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/). I wrote a little more about this in a [blog post about how I use iTerm2](/programming/2021/11/04/how-i-use-iterm2.html).
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for design work. I'm not a designer, and Figma makes it super easy to put together at least basic wireframes and prototypes without really needing to know what you're doing.
- While a lot of people dig Postman, I use [RapidAPI](https://paw.cloud/) to interact with and test APIs. It's feature-rich and works almost exactly the way I want it to.
- [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/faq) whenever I've doing web development on a Windows machine. I spent a long time rotating through various Linux distributions, but these days I don't have the patience or skill to babysit them. And I like video games too much.
- [CleanShot](https://cleanshot.com/) for screenshots and screen recordings. It's super easy to use and makes capturing quick gifs a breeze.
- I have a [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/jsrn/dotfiles) to make my configuration as consistent as possible between systems.
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) and [jless](https://jless.io/) for wrangling JSON data on the command line.
