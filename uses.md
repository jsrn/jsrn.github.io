## Hardware

* [Dell Latitude 5591](https://www.dell.com/en-uk/work/shop/laptops/latitude-5591/spd/latitude-15-5591-laptop), provided by my company. I like it.
* [WASD 104 Key Mechanical Keyboard](http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/products/mechanical-keyboard/wasd-v3-104-key-custom-mechanical-keyboard.html) with a custom colour scheme. I paid way too much to get this thing through customs, but it's served me well.
* For a second screen, I will use whatever I can scrounge from the office.
* Squared or dotted paper and a black gel ink ballpoint or fineliner. I'm not picky about the brand, so long as it doesn't scratch on the paper too much.

## Software

* [JetBrains RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/) for Ruby development.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for everything else.
* [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for design work.
* [Notion](https://notion.so) for taking notes.
* [Todoist](https://todoist.com) for holding chaos at bay.
