<p>One of the first things I decided to do when I made the decision to improve my design skills was to work through the <a href="https://www.dailyui.co/">DailyUI</a> challenges.</p>

<div class="daily-ui-container">
  {% for design in site.data.dailyui %}
  <div>
    <strong>{{ design.name }}</strong>
    <a href="{{ design.url }}"><img src="{{ design.url }}" alt=""></a>
  </div>
  {% endfor %}
</div>
