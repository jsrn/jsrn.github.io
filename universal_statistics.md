# Universal Statistics

If I were omniscient and could build a list of interesting statistics about the universe, here's what I'd like to know.

* Time saved by attempts to automate tasks with software.
* Time _wasted_ by attempts to automate tasks with software.
* Number of times I've thrown something in the bin on the first attempt.
  * How this compares to people I know.
* Number of times "I'm not X, but..." has been followed by something incredibly X.
