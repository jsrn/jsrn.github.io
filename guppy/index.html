            <h2>charm earrings - August 14, 2014</h2>

            <p>First upload in aaaaaaaaaages. I made these a few days ago - acrylic & glass beads & copper coloured findings. I guess I'll either gift them to friends or donate them to a fundraiser.</p>

            <p>I have a bunch of other jewellery to photograph & submit (no drawings atm). Hopefully I'll get around to that soon.</p>
