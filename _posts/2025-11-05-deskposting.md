  if your chat friends ask for a pic of your legs be careful. its probably a trick to examine the bg of the pic for a strange tv/desk setup or poor cable management. they dont actually want to see your legs

I love getting to be nosy with people's workspaces. Sadly for me, a lot of workspace photos (look at the front page of [r/battlestations](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/) and you'll see what I mean) are beautiful but... sanitary. They're clean. They're extremely tidy. They're Instagram Perfect. They appear untouched by human hands. This is fair. They're being posted online, and the dangers of leaving a visible photo with a scrap of home address are real.

What I love, though, is a photo that gives a sense of the person whose space it is. Something that goes beyond their taste in RGB lighting and generous keyboard budget[^keeb] and instead reveals the texture of their days. The towering stacks of papers. The cup of coffee they made because they forgot they already had one. The DIY they had to do to make the space work _at all_. The books they refer to while they're working and the books they want people to _think_ they refer to while working. [Bud Smith's truck desk](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2025/10/29/truck-desk/) has texture.

Every now and then I'm lucky enough to get desk shots from work, a group chat, or smaller forum where people feel like they can be a bit more candid, and boy oh boy do I zoom in.

The state of some of these cables, honestly.

[^keeb]: Though I absolutely do want to see your expensive keyboard.
