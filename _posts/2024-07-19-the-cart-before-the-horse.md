I've been getting occasional push notifications from Airalo, Trainline, and Uber, retailers of e-SIMs, train tickets, and taxi rides, suggesting that I go on holiday. Ever the shrewd observer, I detect their true motivation. Not that I should have a lovely time at the seaside, but that in so doing, I might find myself in a position to give them money.

Here's the thing: lousy with privilege as I am, I'm familiar with the concept of "a holiday." I don't need a utility company to remind me that trains exist to prompt me to take a trip. I know about trains. It's worse coming from Uber. It just sounds like "hey man, we noticed you haven't left the house in a while." That's true, and sure, it's concerning, but it's none of their business.

It feels like my electricity company sending me lists of appliances I could buy, or my water company helpfully reminding me to shower more or buy a bunch of plants.

Frustratingly, none of these apps provide an obvious way to turn off promotional notifications while keeping the notifications I might actually want, like train delays, or that I've used almost all of my data.

Respectfully, I'll get in touch if I need something.
