I've kept a work diary for a long time. For any given work day in the past several years, I have a pretty good record of what I did, what was interesting or difficult about it, and what I plan to do next. It's not always pretty, but it's a great working memory for notes or to-dos to get triaged into something more suitable.

This makes stand-ups easy. "What did you do yesterday and what are you going to do today? Any questions or blockers?" Please sit tight, this is going to take a while.

I sometimes have to remind myself that while my manager wants to know that I'm doing my job, I doubt most of my team mates are that interested in the trivia of every task I worked on the day before.

I try to remind myself that these conversations aren't for showing off how blisteringly productive you can be. They're for making sure your team knows about _the stuff that's relevant to them_. Stuff that contributes to the heartbeat of the team. Work that plays out at the intersection of yours and theirs.
