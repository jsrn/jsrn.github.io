About a year ago, I wrote <a href="http://jsrn.net/programming/2013/06/12/collagepy/" target="_blank">Collage.py</a>, a script for tiling game screenshots. This week, I rewrote it in ruby and released it as a rails application, deployed on <a href="https://heroku.com">heroku</a>. It's not the biggest or most complicated rails project I've worked on, but it's the first I can really call more-or-less complete, and I'm very happy with it.

You can use it <a href="http://screenshot-collage.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">here</a> and check out the code <a href="https://github.com/jsrn/Collage" target="_blank">here</a>.

It's only really a couple of routes, a bootstrap theme and one module, but hey! Milestone!
