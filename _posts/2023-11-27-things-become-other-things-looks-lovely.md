I had the good fortune to be introduced to [Craig Mod's blog](https://craigmod.com) and newsletters just in time for TOKIO TŌKYŌ TOKYO³, his six day, 150km walk from one edge of Tōkyō-to to the other.

His book _[Things Become Other Things](https://shop.specialprojects.jp/products/things-become-other-things-1st-ed)_ has just launched, and I intend to quietly covet it until I die. It's sadly a little outside my impulse purchase range once you factor in taxes and shipping. Still, I'm a sucker for a well-bound book, and wow, has a lot of attention been put into this.

[The YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4u5_UyQoyw) showing off the printing and binding process is worth a watch even if you have no interest in the book itself.
