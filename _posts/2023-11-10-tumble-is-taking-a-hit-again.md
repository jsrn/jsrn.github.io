From [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23954412/tumblr-downscaling-employees-transferred-automattic):

> Tumblr is downscaling its ambitions after failing to reach goals for a new audience, aiming to move some staff members to other divisions of parent company Automattic.

I've never really been active on Tumblr, but this still makes me sad. The site has a unique community, and this is just another thing they don't need. It sucks when your community is just a piece of somebody else's portfolio of revenue streams.

> There have been a few staff changes within the team, but basically what we’re saying is starting January 1st, 2024 we’ll try a different structure with smaller, more focused teams working on the core parts of Tumblr that people say they want improved. We’ll sunset or rollback some things we tried that didn’t work.

A glimmer of hope. Fingers crossed we're not going to be hearing about Tumblr's [incredible journey](https://ourincrediblejourney.tumblr.com/) in Q2.
