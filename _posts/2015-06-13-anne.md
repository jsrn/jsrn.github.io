I've recently started using rubocop to keep my code aligned (more or less) with the [community styleguide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide). rubocop is great, but I quickly found that I wanted a feature that didn't seem readily available.

I wanted to be able to run rubocop before each commit, and only have it check the files that I'd changed. Sure, you can type the filenames manually, e.g. `rubocop file_1.rb file_2.rb`, but who has time to take out of their day to type a whole 15-20 keystrokes?

That's why I created [anne](https://github.com/jsrn/anne), rubocop's partner in crime-fighting. At the moment, anne just runs `git status -s` in your working directory and sends all files to rubocop.

It's easy to install and use.

<pre>
$ gem install anne
$ anne
