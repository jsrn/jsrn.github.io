2023 was a good year for my reading habits. I always keep a [record](/library) of the books I've read, but this year I thought I'd share the list here. I've put a star next to my ten (-ish, I couldn't narrow it down any more) favourites, but there's nothing on the list that I didn't enjoy at all. Most significantly, it's the year that I started reading Joan Didion's work. She'd have more stars, but after a point it begins to feel unfair. I just picked my favourite.
