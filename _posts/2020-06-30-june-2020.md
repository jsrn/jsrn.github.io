# Keeping Politics Out of Tech

It's uncomfortable to think about oppression. It's extremely uncomfortable to consider the ways in which you might be complicit in that oppression.

However, everything you say and everything you do is a vote for the kind of person you want to be and the kind of world you want to live in. Silence and inaction are a vote for the status quo.

I don't want to be the kind of person who is content to tell people to suffer in silence because I have the privilege to treat the politics that have tangible, negative effects on their lives as a thought experiment.
