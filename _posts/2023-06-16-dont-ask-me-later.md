This is just a minor vent, but why are notification choices so often just:

1. Yes
2. Not right now, but please keep asking me

"No, please don't ask again" is a frustratingly rare option. I know, I know. Notifications drive engagement and you're incentivised to keep pestering me until I give in. I empathise with your situation.

However, I do wish you'd stop.
