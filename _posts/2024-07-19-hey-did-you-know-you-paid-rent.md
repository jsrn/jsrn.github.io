While I'm [complaining about notifications](https://jsrn.net/2024/07/19/the-cart-before-the-horse.html), I'd like to talk about the system my letting agent uses to handle rent payments.

When I pay rent, which is by far the worst part of my month, I get:

- A push notification from my bank, telling me how much money I just spent.
- A text from my letting agent, telling me how much money I just spent.
- An email from my letting agent, telling me how much money I just spent.
- A few days after the previous email I get another email, with the header "**payment is due**" and under an angry looking red glyph, the text "this is to confirm that there is no outstanding balance."

See, I *know* when I pay rent. Not just because it happens automatically at exactly the same time every month, but because of the deep psychic damage that strikes me wherever I may be when it happens.

I don't need to be told about it **four times**.
