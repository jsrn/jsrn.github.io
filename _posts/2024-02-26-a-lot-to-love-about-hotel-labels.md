There's an extensive collection of scanned hotel luggage tags available at <http://hotel-label.com>, found via [Present and Correct](https://www.presentandcorrect.com) via [kottke.org](https://kottke.org). I haven't been able to bring myself to close the tab on my phone, which tells me I have to do something to get it out of my system.

I love them.

I love the labels themselves because of the effort they must take to create and produce. Each one gives you an impression of how each hotel saw itself, or wanted to be seen. Someone (proud owner? Hurried intern? Proud owner’s teenager who pirated Photoshop?) has taken the effort to turn something functional into something unique and aesthetically pleasing.

I love the fact that someone felt the need to create this archive. It’s an interesting glimpse into the time and place from which each one came that we wouldn’t have without the obvious effort that’s been poured into this website.
