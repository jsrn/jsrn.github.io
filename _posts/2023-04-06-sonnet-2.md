Through PHP and Java, skills were born \
But settled now on Ruby, life's true love. \
To not look down on past projects with scorn \
But elevate my craft and look above.

O, Ruby! A Bridgetown site could not hold \
My love for thee, inside of markdown lines. \
A fresh Rails application could not load. \
Your name in the Gemfile - a thousand times.

Metaprogramming a new DSL \
With nested blocks and elegant syntax \
Cannot capture the rush of my heart's swell \
For all the language holds, still my tongue lacks.

Ruby 3, YJIT too, and also minitest \
Static sites and CLIs! Ruby, you're the best.
