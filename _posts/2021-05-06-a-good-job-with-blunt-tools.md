I'm signed up to the e-mail newsletter of a local walkway.

Exciting, I know. This monthly newsletter boasts a circulation of roughly 250 keen readers and it comes full of pictures of local flowers, book reviews, and that sort of thing.

This newsletter comes to me as a PDF from the personal email account of the group secretary. My email address in tucked away in the BCC field. As it happens, Gmail lets you send an email to [up to 500 people at once](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/22839?hl=en-GB#zippy=%2Cyou-have-reached-the-limit-for-sending-emails).

The point of this is that there's no obsession over things like...

* what happens when I have ten million subscribers?
* why hasn't jsrn opened one of my emails in a while?
* am I using the right newsletter provider? Is it one of the *cool* ones?

I can only imagine the list of subscribers is kept in a spreadsheet somewhere on the secretary's computer.

I hope he has a backup.
