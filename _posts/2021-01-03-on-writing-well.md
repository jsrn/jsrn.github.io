I've been reading [On Writing Well](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53343.On_Writing_Well) by William Zinsser. One of the early instructions he gives is to cut out filler words.

~~Well,~~ I have a confession to make. I'm particularly guilty of one particular habit that I just can't seem to shake.

I start a lot of sentences with "well," and, ~~well,~~ it's something I've been trying to cut down on.

Out of interest, I just ran the following search in my employer's Slack:

```
from:@james Well,
```

The results were not pleasing. I don't want to say how many times I've done it within Slack's recent memory, but I didn't dare venture past page 1 of 36.

~~Well,~~ that just won't do.

I don't even know why I do it. It's not a hedging word, designed to protect me from any criticism I might incur from taking a firm position, as it does nothing to minimise the strength of the statement that follows it. It's just a noise I make, involuntarily, like _um_ or _ah_.

It's five characters (and a space) I can do without.
