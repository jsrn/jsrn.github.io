Not everything has to eat the world and the definition of success isn't always

- be the one true _Thing_, or at least be the most popular version of _The Thing_;
- last forever, with infinite growth;
- meet 100% of the use cases of the last _Thing_, and more.

Life, people, and technology are all more complicated than that.

It's hard to be attached to something and have it fade away, but that's part of being a human being and existing in the flow of time. That's table stakes. I have treasured memories of childhood friends who I haven't heard from in 20 years. Internet communities that came and went. They weren't less valuable because they didn't last forever.

Let a thing just be what it is. So what if it doesn't pan out the way you expected? If the value you derive from _The Thing_ is reliant on its permanence, you're setting yourself up for disappointment anyway.

Alternatively, abandon _The Thing_ altogether and, I dunno, go watch a movie or something. The world is your oyster.

No points for figuring out which drama I'm referring to.
