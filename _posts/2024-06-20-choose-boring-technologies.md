Technology choices aren't free. Worse than that, they charge interest.

Here are a few ways I've seen costly situations develop:

- A prototype built with a technology you're "just trying out" gets promoted to production.
- Your chosen technologies evolve faster than your capacity to keep up.
- You used to have the personnel to maintain things, but attrition sapped your resources.
- The "best practice" you followed assumes an organisation of a vastly different size or structure.
