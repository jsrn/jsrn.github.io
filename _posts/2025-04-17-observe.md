Note: This post applies mainly applies to people in my own demographic intersection. YMMV.

We live in a globally connected world, in which many of our labours are separated from the turning of the soil and the seasons.

In the middle ages, you could hardly move for Saint's days and feast days. We still have the biggies, of course, but previously the year was punctuated with observances to a much greater degree than we're used to now. Now, I don't even notice when the clocks change. Our phones update silently while we snooze, and two nights out of the year, we wake up inexplicably grouchy or well-rested.

So, for the past few years I've peppered my calendar with observances to give me little somethings to celebrate throughout the year.

Some are seasonal, like full moons and solstices. Some are global observances, like the anniversary of Neil banging out the tunes (this Sunday just gone), Bat Appreciation Day (today, April 17) or any of the dates in my (always in-progress) [Year in Movies](https://jsrn.net/year-in-movies/) page.

Happy Bat Appreciation Day to those that celebrate. &#129415;
