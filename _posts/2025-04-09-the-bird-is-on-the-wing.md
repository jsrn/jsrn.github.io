I got really into the *story* of _The Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám_ as translated by Edward Fitzgerald when I read about it in Emma Park's article in [issue 80 of _Idler_](https://www.idler.co.uk/sample-issue/).

Two[^two] people united across time and language by out-of-steppishness, love of a good book, a good sit down, and a bottle of wine within arm's reach.

Both the article and the Rubáiyát are well worth reading. There are some beautifully bound editions of the Rubáiyát available (I guess they know their target audience) but you can [grab a well-presented e-book edition for free at Standard Ebooks](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/omar-khayyam/the-rubaiyat-of-omar-khayyam/edward-fitzgerald).

[^two]: I say two, but when people keep publishing things anonymously it's hard to guarantee attribution.
