title: The iOS Journal app is missing a critical feature
description: It doesn't matter how nice the rest of the app is if you can't export your journal entries.
---

I'm not sure when it landed, but I just noticed a new app on my iOS home screen: Journal.

I've maintained a consistent but low intensity journaling habit and I've put down some 213,969 words since 2011. So, while I'm happy enough with my set-up, I always like playing with new toys and I thought I’d take a look at what the Journal app has to offer.

Here’s my review: It looks nice and it does some nice things, but they don't matter. It currently lacks the one thing I believe to be non-negotiable in a journaling app: there’s no obvious way to export my data. I've deliberately picked basic tools and simple formats for my journal because I don't know what the future holds or what shape technology will take. Will I still be using an iPhone in five years? Probably. What about twenty? What about fifty? Will smart phones even be a _thing_ in fifty years?

If I can’t pick up my data in a portable format and walk away at any time, none of the other bells or whistles are enough.

Otherwise, it is quite good.
