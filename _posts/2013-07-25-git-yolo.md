I saw something pretty funny on reddit today.

<img src="/images/git-yolo.png">

http://whatthecommit.com spits out a random example of the fairly bad commit messages we see on a daily basis, poking light fun at something I'm definitely guilty of, along with countless others.

	"I would rather be playing SC2."
	"lots and lots of changes"
	"8==========D"
	"added security."

A bright spark by the name of neoice posted the following alias:

	alias git-yolo='git commit -am "`curl -s http://whatthecommit.com/index.txt`"'

This commits the entire set of changes in your workspace with a random message from whatthecommit.

Into the .zshrc it goes.

*P.S. This post contained more instances of the word "yolo" than I'm truly comfortable with.*
