I've been through a couple different approaches to keeping track of all the things I want to get done. I've used pens and paper. I briefly flirted with becoming the kind of person who bullet journals, but that didn't last. I've used a couple different apps, not quite bringing myself to pull the trigger on an expensive Omnifocus license and instead handing management of my life to the capable, more capable every year, Todoist.

Sadly, I'm yet to find a tool that replaces the grizzly work of actually doing things.
