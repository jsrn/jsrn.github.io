I can usually muddle through whatever programming task is put in front of me, but I can't claim to have a great eye for design. I'm firmly in the [conscious incompetence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence) stage of making things look good.

The good news for me and people like me is that you can fake it. Sort of. I doubt I'll ever compete with people who _actually_ know what they're doing, but I have found some resources for making something that doesn't look like the dog's dinner.

- [_Design for Hackers_ by David Kadavy](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/11457105-design-for-hackers) - A great introduction to typography, colour theory and spacing.
- [_Refactoring UI_ by Adam Wathan and Steve Schoger](https://www.refactoringui.com/) - Great tips for layouts and UI components, with actionable tips, before/after, and clear explanations of why some things look good and some things look... not good. If you don't want to take a chance on the book, which to be fair is quite expensive, it's worth going through their [list of design tips on Twitter](https://twitter.com/i/events/994601867987619840) and their [Refactoring UI blog on Medium](https://medium.com/@refactoringui).

I'd like to add some more free resources to this, so hopefully I'll get back to it.
