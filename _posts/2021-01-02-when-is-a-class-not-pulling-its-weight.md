> I use Inline Class if a class is no longer pulling its weight and shouldnâ€™t be around any more. Often this is the result of refactoring that moves other responsibilities out of the class so there are little left.

I recently finished reading [Refactoring: Ruby Edition](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoringRubyEd.html), and while there was a lot of talk about extracting logic into single purpose classes, there was also mention of removing classes that weren't deemed to be "pulling their weight."

This left me with a question. How little is too little? I'm assuming that when the author says there is little left in the class, they don't mean there's _nothing_ left, so what sort of classes might exist that don't deserve the mental space they occupy?

The example given in the book is that of a `TelephoneNumber` class which is quite close to simply being a [value object](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html), but without the immutability or comparison logic. Its only role is to put an area code and a phone number into a nicely formatted string. This logic is pulled into the `Person` class, to whom the phone number belongs.

So say you've got class `B` that you're considering merging into class `A`. Some good reasons to make this merge might be:

* `B` only operates on instances of `A` or its fields.
* `B` is only referenced by `A`.
* You struggle to differentiate between the domain concepts modeled by `A` and `B`.

I think it's less a question of whether a class has enough responsibility, and more a question of whether a class has enough responsibility _that rightfully belongs to it_.
