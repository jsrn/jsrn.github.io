## Quitting Coffee

### 20th

#### 10:10

If all has gone to plan, the beautiful ambrosia that sits before me now will be my last cup of coffee between now and when I post this.

I used to drink an absurd amount of coffee. I now drink less. Maybe two or three cups a day at most. I don't think I want to do it any more. It's currently 10 to 10 in the morning (cowboy time!) and I am just getting to the bottom of that mug. I don't like the way it feels. My tongue feels sticky. My throat feels gummy. I feel like I'm sweating. It tastes pretty good, but it's not worth feeling so gross after a cup or two. Is it normal to feel this gross?

#### 11:56

I have recovered from the morning cup.

#### 14:43

I normally would have gone for my second cup by now, but I'm just drinking several cups of tea instead.

### 24th

Drinking tea instead of coffee and I'm tired and it feels like my brain is too big for my skull. Is this caffeine withdrawal? I could do without it. How about that second cup of tea?

### 27th

Through the power of numerous cups of tea, I do not particularly miss the coffee. Except occasionally when I really miss the coffee.

## Thought Bubble

I was at the [Thought Bubble Festival](https://www.thoughtbubblefestival.com/) over the weekend. I'm not really into comics. I enjoy reading them, but I can only name a few artists or writers, and I don't really have the encyclopedic knowledge of the medium that many other comic fans seem to have.

I had a really good time and bought maybe too many comics. My favourite ones tend to be small diary style comics for a couple reasons. Firstly, the cost of comics adds up *fast*. If you want to support a bunch of different creators without blowing the budget, small comics and zines are the way to go. Secondly, I enjoy diary comics for the same reason I enjoy reading about people's routines and workflows: the minutiae of our lives are worth sharing, and there is often a bunch we can learn from or just enjoy about them.

Here's what I got:
