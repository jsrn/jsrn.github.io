I was standing at a bus stop reading old issues of the Roden newsletter when I came to the above passage. Not knowing what “glabrous” meant and having a world of knowledge at my fingertips, I highlighted it and tapped the prompt to look it up in the dictionary.

> glabrous | ˈɡleɪbrəs. \
> adjective (technical). \
> (chiefly of the skin or a leaf) free from hair or down; smooth.

Neat. However, iOS decided that a simple dictionary definition wasn't enough. No, iOS thought a visual aid from the Wikipedia page for "pubic hair removal" would be just the thing: two big sets of glabrous, high resolution genitalia. It was certainly enough to educate me as to the meaning of the word, and I'm sure those I was shoulder to shoulder with learned a thing or two as well.

Thanks, Apple.
