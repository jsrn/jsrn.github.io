1. A booking system where participants' shared meeting availability is arranged on screen like in Atari Breakout and players break blocks until only one remains
2. [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com) but for markdown variants

4. AWS feature request: a big red button I can press that just deletes anything that’s going to rack up a bill just by existing.
