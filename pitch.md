title: My brilliant ideas at no cost to you, the reader
---

1. A booking system where participants' shared meeting availability is arranged on screen like in Atari Breakout and players break blocks until only one remains
2. [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com) but for markdown variants
3. Powerful ancient Romans would have servants follow them, whispering reminders of their own mortality. For just £4 per month, I will provide this service to you via email or Twitter DM.
4. AWS feature request: a big red button I can press that just deletes anything that’s going to rack up a bill just by existing.
5. "HTTP 209 k." Like 200 OK but it’s kinda mad at you.
6. Business idea to target stressed grownups: a model city that you can rampage through and destroy while bellowing like godzilla.
7. Collab between Wes Craven and Wes Anderson.
