I'm a web developer from the UK. These days, I mainly write Ruby code and JavaScript using Ruby on Rails.

Head on over and read the <a href="writing.html">stuff I wrote</a>.

I <a href="https://twitter.com/jsrndoftime">tweet</a> a bunch and have a bunch of posts on <a href="https://medium.com/@jsrn">medium</a> that I'm planning on bringing back over here.
