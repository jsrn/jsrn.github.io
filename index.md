Hi. My name is James and I have been a web developer since 2011. I mainly use Ruby on Rails but I have aspirations of calling myself a <span class="hover-horse">full stack developer</span> <img src="/assets/images/full-stack.jpg">.

Head on over and read the stuff that I <a href="https://twitter.com/jsrndoftime">tweeted</a>, and stuff that I wrote <a href="writing">here</a> and on <a href="https://medium.com/@jsrn">medium.com</a>.

Check out my <a href="zines.html">zines</a> and <a href="sudo">terrible music</a>.
