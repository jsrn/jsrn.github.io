<h2 id="welcome">Welcome</h2>

So you've decided to become a professional software developer. Congratulations. I'm sorry. It's a wonderful and exciting and stressful and sometimes harrowing line of work. I hope this helps make your first few weeks slightly easier.

I say the first few weeks and I mean it--this isn't about how to build the perfect software development career. It's not about setting a roadmap for the next five or ten years. It's about that first three or four weeks of finding your feet in a new environment, surrounded by new people, doing new things.

Enjoy.


<h2 id="expectations">Setting Expectations</h2>

You want your first few weeks in the job to be successful. To achieve this, you need to define "success" and that is largely to be defined in terms of what your new employer expects from you.

Quite often, your company will have a plan for what your first days or weeks will look like. You may be assigned to shadow or pair with a more established team member to see how they work. There may be a collection of low-hanging tickets that the team have set aside for you to cut your teeth on.

Often there is a specific goal in mind: a new employee should ship working code on their first day.


<h2 id="speed">Getting Up To Speed</h2>

* How does the team operate? [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/scrum-guide)? [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development))? Something [else](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process)? It's worth developing a working understanding of the team's overall approach, at least to make participating in early conversations easier.
* What does the organisational chart look like? How big is your team and how does that relate to the overall company?
* Where is the code kept and how do you pull it into your development environment?
* What tools do the team use?
* What conventions do the team follow in terms of code style, etc?



<h2 id="writing">Writing Things Down</h2>

As you gather information, you'll want to have a system for recording it. As you have questions or observations, you can write them down to get answers later. It's useful to keep a development journal, of which a lot has been written already, and I've been heavily inspired by the section on engineering daybooks in [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/).


<h2 id="help">Asking For Help</h2>

A 2021 [~~study~~ Twitter poll](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1378029651012984834?s=20) by [Shawn "swyx" Wang](https://www.swyx.io/), the results of which I've reproduced below, suggests that the majority of respondants think you should work on something independently for around 1-4 hours before seeking help. This is something of a sweet spot: struggling with it independently will give you an opportunity to learn without having your hand held while still ensuring that you don't spend *too* much time that your team might prefer you were doing something else with.

When you do ask for help, make it as easy as possible for people to help you. Tell them *what* you're trying to do and *why*. Tell them *what you've tried so far* and tell them *what's going wrong now*.

Don't ask permission to ask a question. Just come out with it and if people are too busy or don't know the answer, they'll either let you know or let the question sit there for someone else. The result for you is the same, but the people helping you no longer need to do the legwork to find out what the problem is.
