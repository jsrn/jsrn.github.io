<h2>Log</h2>

<h3>5th August 2020</h3>

<p>I managed to get my hands on the seeds of some heirloom tomatoes. It's too late in the year to plant them, but if I dry them properly (which I have never attempted), I should be able to enjoy them around this time next year. The plan is roughly as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scoop the seeds out of some fancy tomatoes.</li>
  <li>Rinse them in a sieve to remove the remainder of the tomato juice.</li>
  <li>Leave them to dry in some paper towel.</li>
  <li>Once absolutely dry, store in small envelopes in safe, dry place.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6th August 2020</h3>

<p>The seeds are looking pretty dry. So dry, in fact, that many of them can't be separated from the paper towel without damage. Paper towel is biodegradable, so I'm hoping that if push comes to shove, I can just cut the seeds away and plant them, towel and all.</p>

<p>On a happier note, the tomatoes seem to be happier now that I've doubled their water. Bloody things might actually ripen, now.</p>

<h3>7th August 2020</h3>

<p>A happy day: an orchid has bloomed, and one of our Thai Dragon peppers is happily ripening on the plant. It's still got a tinge of green, but I expect it'll be ready soon.</p>

<p>The reddening of the pepper turned out to be an ill omen. The red was the red of blood. I bought some dahlias and immediately decapitated them with the garden door.</p>

<h3>8th August 2020</h3>

<p>Collected the dried tomato seeds and put them into plastic pots. Some of the seeds were difficult to cleanly separate from the paper towel, the mucous lining of the seed having served as a sort of glue. Hopefully that'll be alright.</p>

<p>For future reference:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Green top: watermelon looking ones</li>
  <li>Purple top: orange ones.</li>
  <li>Pink top: dark red with green stripes</li>
</ul>
