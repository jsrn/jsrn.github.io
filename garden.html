<h3>5th August 2020</h3>

<p>I managed to get my hands on the seeds of some heirloom tomatoes. It's too late in the year to plant them, but if I dry them properly (which I have never attempted), I should be able to enjoy them around this time next year. The plan is roughly as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scoop the seeds out of some fancy tomatoes.</li>
  <li>Rinse them in a sieve to remove the remainder of the tomato juice.</li>
  <li>Leave them to dry in some paper towel.</li>
  <li>Once absolutely dry, store in small envelopes in safe, dry place.</li>
</ul>
