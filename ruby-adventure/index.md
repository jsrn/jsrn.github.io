title: "Ruby Adventure: Your first text adventure"
---

This book is a love letter to the Ruby programming language. It's a guide to help you create your first text adventure in Ruby and a guide to help you improve your overall programming abilities.

However, I'm going to try to avoid re-hashing 101 concepts that are presented better elsewhere in favour of directing readers to the appropriate documentation. There's a lot that I am sure I have not and could not talk about enough and there's a lot that I will no doubt talk about too much. I hope there is value to be found between these pages anyway. Any feedback is greatly appreciated.

I'm not going to cover the very basics of installing Ruby and using it to run Ruby applications. Instead, I recommend taking a look at [Try Ruby](https://try.ruby-lang.org/) on the official Ruby website. It'll take you through a lot of the concepts that we'll be building upon in this book.

And now if you've got this far, I'd recommend installing a good text editor for your code. At the time of writing, [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the standard. Life's too short to not have syntax highlighting.
